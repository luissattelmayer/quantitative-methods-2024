# Advanced RStudio Labsessions

This repository contains all the course material for the RStudio Labsessions for the Spring semester 2024 at the School of Research at SciencesPo Paris. The class follows [Jan Rovny's lecture on Quantitative Methods II](https://www.rovny.org/methods-2-ed). Furthermore, this course is a direct continuation of [Malo Jan's RStudio introduction course](https://github.com/malojan/intro_r?tab=readme-ov-file). If you feel the need to go back to some basics of general R use, data management or visualization, feel free to check out his [course's website](https://malo-jn.quarto.pub/introduction-to-r/). Rest assured, however, that 1) we will recap plenty of things, 2) make slow but steady progress, 3) and come back to the essentials of data wrangling again during the semester while constructing statistical models. 

The structure of the class is as follows
